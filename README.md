A small class for easily adding WP Cron tasks (jobs).

This Class allow you to create WordPress Cron tasks in a quick and simple way. In order not to confuse anything, all settings are specified in the first parameter when calling the class. The class takes care of the entire routine of correctly registering the Cron task and their intervals. The task handler (the function) need to be written separately in PHP!
